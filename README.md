# God's Eye
Semester 5 - CS3282 - Industrial Computer Engineering Project
## Introduction
People and vehicle tracking is a very important job to law enforcement forces and it is a very tedious task to do in manual mode. God,s eye will take camera feeds from different angle and highlight the specific object and give it's path when possible.

## Issues to be addressed
* Background fluctuations
* Image noise
* Rain, snow, turbulence
* Illumination changes & shadows
* Providing real time system

## Proposed System
Below is a diagram which describes the implementation of the system

## Project Plan
Tasks/Applications to be implemented in upcoming weeks:
* Frame pre-processing
* Object detection
* Object extraction
* Feature extraction
* Object tracking sequence
* Object tracking algorithm

Weeks reserved for further testing (integration testing) and/or to catch up on any delays or failures in prior weeks.
